Users have the option to hide the number of likes on a post. For these posts, Instaloader returns -1 as the number of likes

Downloading images from Instagram means making a bunch of additional requests, which increases the probability of getting blocked.
If we want to have undergrads classify posts as sponsored or not, we can just give them the post links. We don't have to download the images.

How can we reliably identify sponsored posts?

Types of sponsored posts:
(1) "Paid partnership with @xyz": we identify these with the Instaloader Python package

(2) Some sort of hashtag in the caption showing that the post is sponsored, like #ad, #sponsored, etc. We already identify these.

(3) A hashtag in the comments (#ad etc.): I'm scraping the chronologically earliest comment on the post, and if the comment is by the original poster, I save the hashtags in the comment.

(4) A post like this: https://www.instagram.com/p/CeRQ6CkoHe4. I assume this post is sponsored by Mclaren. To identify this we probably need to use the fact that he tags @mclarenauto in the post. Maybe there's some list of Instagram accounts that post actual Instagram ads. If a post tags one of those accounts, it could be evidence that the post is sponsored.

(5) A post like this: https://www.instagram.com/p/CfwoUtLpttu. It may be impossible to determine whether a post like this is sponsored without doing image processing. The payment structure here may also be different. It could be that, rather than getting a fee per post, Selena Gomez is required to post a certain number of times as part of her contract with Sephora.

We can reliably classify (1) and (2) as sponsored. (3) could be improved by scraping all comments from the original poster and looking at the hashtags. As James mentioned previously, this may slow the code down or create issues due to sending too many requests to Instagram. It may not be worthwile to try to do (5) at this point. However, I think (4) is very important because many sponsored posts have this format. If we don't identify posts of type (4) as sponsored, we'll miss a lot.

Ideas to classify (4) as sponsored:
Get list of tagged users in post, see if any of them are business accounts.

Issue with (4): influencers may create fake sponsored posts. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/influencers-are-faking-brand-deals/578401/
